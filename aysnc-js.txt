aysnc javascript:

Topics to cover
    timeouts and intervals
    callbacks
    promises
    async await
    event loop


Javscript is synchronous

if we 2 functions code execute top down approach

Js is blocking
No matter how much time a task is taking , further code will not execute even will code takes 10 minutes or 10seconds

Js is single threaded
A thread is simply a process that javascript code use to run a task
Each thread can do one task at a time
Js has just one thread called main thread for executing the code

This behaviour of js can be problematic , what if we have to retrieve data from database and perform opertaions on it

here we need asynchronous code
