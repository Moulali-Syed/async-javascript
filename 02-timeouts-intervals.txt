Traditional methods javascript has available for running asynchronous code

after a set time period elapsed
at regular intervals of time

that is
setTimeout()
setInterval()

setTimeout function executes a particular block of code once after a specified time elapsed


setTimeout(function,duration,param1,param2,....)

1st parameter is a function
2nd parameter is time
3rd and so on can be zero parameters passed or can pass any 
number of parameters so that we can use them when code is executing

function greet(){
    console.log( 'Hello');
}

setTimeout(greet,2000)

//logs Hello to console after 2 seconds


function greet(name){
    console.log(`hello ${name}`);
}
setTimeout(greet,2000,'apple');

//after 2 seconds hello apple will be printed on console

To clear timeout we can use clearTimeout() method by passing in indentifier returned by setTimeout as a parameter

function greet(){
    console.log('Hello');
}

const timeoutId = setTimeout(greet,2000);
clearTimeout(timeoutId);

//Nothing will be printed to console as greet function will never execute


setInterval()

To run a code repeatedly again and again in regular intervals we use setInterval
setInterval(function,duration,param1,param2,....)

function greet(){

    console.log('Hello');
}
setInterval(greet,2000);

//logs hello after every 2 seconds

setInterval runs indefinitly u should do clearInterval

const intervalid = setInterval(greet,2000);
clearInterval(intervalid)

Noteworthy:
timeouts and intervals are not part of javascript they are browser functionalities 
setTimeout and setInterval are names given to them

the duration specified is minimum delay , not guaranteed delay
if something is taking time it will take more time

It is posible to achieve same effect as setInterval with setTimeout being called recursively

setTimeout(function run(){
    console.log('hello');
    setTimeout(run,100);
},100)
duration is guaranteed


setInterval(function run(){
    console.log('hello');
},100)
The duration interval includes the time taken to execute the code you want to run
setInterval is always fixed duration
